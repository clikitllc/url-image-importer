Import images from URLs, CSV files, or WordPress XML exports directly into your WordPress Media Library to use across your entire site!

== Description ==

URL Image Importer allows you to effortlessly import images from URLs, CSV spreadsheets, or WordPress XML export files directly into your Media Library. Simply paste one or multiple image links, upload a CSV file, or import your WordPress export file—and it will handle the rest, importing them all with ease!

The plugin fetches images directly from external links, validates them, and adds them to your Media Library—saving you time and effort. It’s perfect for quickly adding assets to your site without the hassle of downloading files to your computer and manually uploading them to WordPress.

### URL Image Importer Plugin Features

- Import any image directly into your WordPress Media Library from a URL—no file uploads required.
- Import multiple images at once using a **CSV spreadsheet** with image URLs in bulk.
- Import from **WordPress XML export files** to restore or migrate images between sites.
- Works seamlessly with any hosting environment or server setup.
- Automatically validate and save images, ensuring they’re ready to use in your content.
- Get smart recommendations based on available space in your temporary uploads directory.
- Works with any server or hosting provider.
- Upload any size file directly to a connected Infinite Uploads cloud account.
- Uploads directory disk utility for quickly analyzing storage usage in your media library.

### Import Images to your Media Library

Paste in a publicly accessible URL with a compatible file extension or upload a CSV/XML file and enjoy media management ease.

### Bulk Import Support

Allows you to paste multiple URLs, upload a CSV file, or use a WordPress XML export to import several images simultaneously without timing out. It processes one at a time, recursively importing them.

### CSV Imports

Upload a CSV file containing one or more image URLs (and optional metadata). The plugin automatically processes each row and imports all valid images into your Media Library. Perfect for large-scale imports from spreadsheets or external asset lists.

### XML Imports from WordPress Export Feature

Easily import images from a standard WordPress XML export file. The importer automatically parses the XML file, locates image URLs, and downloads them into your Media Library. This is ideal for restoring lost media or transferring content between sites.

### Uploads Disk Utility

The URL Image Importer plugin includes a media library disk utility that shows a breakdown of the files in your uploads directory by type and size. See how many images, videos, archives, documents, code, and other files (like audio) there are and how much space they're taking up.

### FTP/SFTP Client-free File Uploading

Upload files right to the WordPress media library from URLs without additional credentials and settings. Skip the protocol settings, server names, port numbers, usernames, long passwords, and private keys. Grab the image & paste the URL in!

### Compatible with Big File Uploads

Bypass the upload limits on your server, set by your hosting provider, that prevent you from uploading large files to your media library.

### Wanna make your media library infinitely scalable? Move your big files and uploads directory to the cloud.

A large WordPress media library can slow down your server and run up the cost of bandwidth and storage with your hosting provider. Move your uploads directory to the Infinite Uploads cloud to save on storage and bandwidth and improve site performance and security.
